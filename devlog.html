        <h1>Devlog: From the Brink (working title)</h1>
        <p>
            A turn-based PvP game which I'm developing in Godot, based on a D&D campaign that I'm playing with some close friends. 
            This is my first PvP game, and it's also my first Godot project. Not only that, but across all the different genres
            that I explored, I've never developed a turn-based game. First time experiences all around in this project, and that's exactly
            why I'm so passionate about it. Working on this game has been one of the most valuable learning experiences as a dev, both technically
            and creatively. In this devlog, I share the challenges, achievements and thought processes that sprouted from this game.

            <h3>Update: Completed Aspen's Core Moveset!</h3>
            <p>Jan 31, 2025</p>
        </header>
        <p>
            The core moveset of the first character, Aspen, is done! I've been working on this character for a while now, and I'm 
            happy with how their kit's turning out so far. My goal is to release a very early build of the game with 3 (one for each
            archetype) characters so I can get some people testing the game feel and balance. Before I started working on Aspen, I 
            created an outline for which characters I would develop first:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Aspen</li>
            <li>Raouss</li>
            <li>Mival</li>
            <li>Akamien</li>
            <li>Poko</li>
            <li>Sothro</li>
        </ol>
        <p> 
            Aspen's kit is done, so, if I stick to this outline, Raouss will be the next in development. But in any case, I made
            a showcase video for my friends, and will share it here as well cause why not. All of the assets you'll see in the footage 
            below are placeholders, but polish aside the first Aspen's basic moveset is done!

        <details>
            <summary>Who's Aspen?</summary>
            <p>
                Aspen is one of the player character who joined the campaign after the other players. D&D lets players pick 
                one or even multiple classes that have their own skills, specialties and identities. While most of us committed to a 
                single class, Aspen is unique among our party members in that they are both a Fighter and a Wizard. This means that 
                they can do a little bit of everything really, from kicking ass in close-quarter brawls, to sniping unsuspecting 
                foes from afar and casting spells. That versatility was, to me, one of the most defining traits of the character, 
                and that became the driving inspiration for their range of different projectiles. A really cool thing that I found 
                out about Aspen in the campaign is that they have this ability called "Bladesong", which makes them extra speedy
                and <em>really</em> hard to pin down. I knew I just had to reference that in the game somehow, and that's when I had the
                idea of shifting the game's flow to Aspen's POV. Instead of asking what Aspen would look like under the effects of 
                this "Bladesong", I started asking how would everything else look to them. The answer: everything would probably look
                hella slow.

        <p>
            I haven't thought of a moveset for all characters, but I do have some ideas for their base stats, namely Health and Agility.
            Below you can take a look at how I'm planning the base of all characters.

            <p>
                Agility determines how quickly a character can change their position after moving to a quadrant. Everytime a character
                moves to a quadrant, there's a brief moment where they can't move again. I call this "end-lag", where 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <i>End-Lag = 1/Agility seconds</i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Characters with higher Agility have less end-lag, meaning moving to a quadrant isn't as much of a commitment and they can 
                dodge attacks more easily.

            <h3>Prologue</h3>
            <p>Jan 30, 2025</p>
        </header>
            <p>
                The campaign this game is based on is 3 years old now, and I started working on this project during winter break of 2024.
                I'd been wanting to create a game about our campaign for a while, but now that I also wanted to learn Godot, I saw a
                great opportunity to finally turn that idea into reality. I talked to the friends I play with, who are all talented artists, 
                to see if they would be on board to helping me create assets for the game, and they were all super excited about it.
            </p> 

            <p>
                There are 6 player characters in the campaign, all of which I want to make into playable characters in this game. Our 
                gamemaster (who's contributing to the project with some wonderful concept art) suggested that I divide the characters into
                3 classes, for which I drafted character archetypes:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt><b>Brawler</b></dt>
                <dd>
                    Emphasizes high damage with melee attacks that don't fluctuate, always dealing critical hits if
                    charged for long enough. The Brawler rewards players who can read their opponents like a book.
                </dd>
                <dt><b>Skirmisher</b></dt>
                <dd>
                    Focuses on versatility and mobility. The Skirmisher has a range of offensive
                    and defensive tools that let strategic players adapt to any foe.
                </dd>
                <dt><b>Arcanist</b></dt>
                <dd>
                    Magic wielders that typically start off weak, but snowball into living nightmares. 
                    The Arcanist trades consistency for trickery and deception, perfect for those with an affinity for chaos.
                </dd>
            </dl>

                I think the coolest thing about TTRPGs is that they inspire so much creativity. Whenever I work on anything
                related to the characters we created, be it a short animation or drawing, I just get this surge of motivation and creativity.
                It's really hard for me to put a project down when it involves our D&D campaign in some way, and I feel like that's just the
                nature of how TTRPGs are designed. They are designed to make players get invested in a game, typically through story 
                immersion, not just game mechanics. I think, in a way at least, all games aim to immerse players in their worlds, it's 
                just that the way in which players are allowed to interact with the world in a TTRPG and in a video game differs a lot.
