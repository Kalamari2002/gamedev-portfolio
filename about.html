        <h2>My journey</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a CS major at UCSD, and I'm eager to start my career in the software or, better yet, gaming industry!
            In the past 3 years studying computer science, I've gained invaluable experience building apps, programs, algorithms and everything
            code related (this very portfolio began as a course project). But really, I started pursuing this journey all because of
            game development. It was the joy of creating little games with my brother as a kid that led me to this field, and even
            today I'd say video games are still my favorite projects to be a part of.

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding, I also love drawing and animating, which is why most (not all of them ofc) of the sprite animations 
            you'll see in my games are done by me! I'm a big fan of D&D and weird media too, especially horror stories about the
            strange and bizarre.
