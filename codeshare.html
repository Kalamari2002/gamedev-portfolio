    <h1>Code Share</h1>
    <p>
        I was thinking I could maybe use this page to share some pieces of code I wrote, and maybe even relate it to the
        suggestions form. Since I'm learning GDscript, this could be somewhat useful in getting advice on how to improve
        Godot scripting.
    </p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
        Been struggling with how <code>move_and_collide()</code> works. Do I have to multiply it by <code>delta</code>? <del>no</del> <ins>Here's what
        the documentation says:</ins>
    </p>
    <pre>
        This method takes one required parameter: a Vector2 indicating the body's relative movement. 
        Typically, this is your velocity vector multiplied by the frame timestep (delta). If the engine detects a collision 
        anywhere along this vector, the body will immediately stop moving. If this happens, the method will return a 
        KinematicCollision2D object.
    </pre>
    <cite>Taken from <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/physics/using_character_body_2d.html">Godot Official Documentation</a></cite>
    <p><dfn>delta</dfn> here is the time difference between the current frame and the last.</p>
